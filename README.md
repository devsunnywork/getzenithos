## 🌟 Core System Features

### 🧠 Neural Matrix (Explore OS)
The heart of Zenith OS. An immersive, interactive visualization engine for skill acquisition and career trajectory mapping.
- **D3-Powered Skill Trees**: Real-time, interactive graph visualization of learning pathways.
- **Protocol Switching**: Seamlessly toggle between multiple career paths (Fullstack Dev, DevOps, etc.) with preserved progress.
- **Gamified Neural Flow**: 
  - **XP Accumulation**: Earn experience points for every node synchronized.
  - **Rank Elevation**: Level up your operative profile based on mastery.
  - **Daily Streaks**: Maintain system activity through the streak engine.
- **Dynamic Milestones**: Intelligent dashboard cards that calculate precisely how many nodes remain until the next rank.

### 🏆 Professional Credential System
Official recognition of your protocol mastery, integrated directly into the dashboard.
- **Verified Certificates**: Automatic issuance of professional credentials upon 100% pathway completion.
- **Hardware-Accelerated Export**: Client-side high-fidelity PDF generation using `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`.
- **Advanced Verification**: 
  - Unique Credential IDs.
  - Verification Hashes (SHA-256 style) for authenticity.
  - Clear "Issue Date" and "Skill Path" attribution.
- **Visual Lock Mechanism**: Premium dashboard card that activates and unlocks visual overlays only upon reaching 100% synchronization.

### 📚 Academic Core & Learning Hub
A structured environment for institutional knowledge and systematic skill building.
- **Protocol Syllabus**: Comprehensive breakdown of all modules, topics, and learning objectives within a career path.
- **Immersive Player**: A cinema-mode interface for course consumption, featuring neural-link styling and focus modes.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Track module-level progress, completion percentages, and "Efficiency Index".
- **Gamification**: Integrated leaderboards and badge systems (V2.0).

### � Mission Control & Identity Hub
Manage your digital presence and active operations.
- **Identity Protocol**: Centralized profile management including full name, avatar synchronization, and global stats.
- **Active Operations**: Track ongoing tasks and missions with high-priority status indicators.
- **Resource Store**: Internal marketplace to unlock premium protocols and hardware upgrades.

### 🛠️ Strategic Admin Panel
Complete system oversight for administrators.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0+)
- MongoDB Atlas Account
- Git

### Installation Sequence

1. **Protocol Initialization**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devsunnywork/zenith-os.git
   cd zenith-os
   ```

2. **Dependency Synchronization**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Core Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in the `server/` root:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_ultra_secure_secret_key
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **System Launch**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Access Terminal**
   - Head to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Default admin protocols will initialize on the first boot.
